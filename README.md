7, 8, 8.1 and 10. 

Version 1.2.0

## Introduction

There already are several instructions available for disabling Telemetry 
on Windows. 
However this is probably the first easy to use script for this purpose. 

Use of this script should be simple enough for average users and this script 
can be easily verified by IT professionals (to understand how it works and 
ensure there is nothing malicious in it).

## Usage

The script can be downloaded (after reading and accepting `LICENSE`) from 
this GitHub repository (e.g. [Releases](https://github.com/DavisNT/Telemetry-Kill-Script/releases) 
section). After downloading (and extracting) file `Telemetry-Kill-Script.cmd` it 
must be run with Administrator rights (by right clicking on it and selecting 
_Run as Administrator_).

Most likely this script will have to be used again each time when Windows Update 
updates Telemetry related files and/or service.
